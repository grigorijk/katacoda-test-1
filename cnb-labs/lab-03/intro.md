# Description

In this lab we will explore Test Driven Development (or TDD in short) techniques, by using Node.js and testing library Jest. The focus of this exercise is to create a microservice using test driven development techniques.
The base for this service is the shipping service from the "microservices game".
The contract is defined in [swagger](https://swagger.io) [specification yaml file](./contract/shipping_service_contract.yaml), and written service should comply with this contract. You can read the [html version of the contract](./contract/shipping_service_contract.html) or use the [swagger editor](https://editor.swagger.io) to ineract with the file.
